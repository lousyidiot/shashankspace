What is a package and module?


A package is a collection of Python modules that are organized in a directory hierarchy. 
It allows you to group related modules together, making it easier to manage and distribute your code.
A package typically contains an `__init__.py` file, which can be empty or contain initialization code for the package.


A module, on the other hand, is a single file containing Python code.
